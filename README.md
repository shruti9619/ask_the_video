# Ask the Video: Revolutionizing How We Interact with Video Content

In an era where video content dominates our digital landscape, the ability to extract meaningful insights from videos is more important than ever. That’s where this project, **Ask the Video**, comes in. I’m excited to share how this innovative tool can transform the way we engage with video content, making it easier to find information and answers in a visual medium.

## What is Ask the Video?

**Ask the Video** is a cutting-edge application that allows users to interact with video content by asking questions in natural language. The project leverages advanced technologies like machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to enable users to obtain answers directly from videos, rather than having to scrub through hours of footage. This project is designed to enhance accessibility, improve user experience, and save time.


## Use Cases

### Educational Content

For educators and students, **Ask the Video** can significantly enhance learning experiences. When revisiting something we do not need to go through the video again but just ask the relevant question and the LLM will bring the relevant response from the particular section.

## Getting Started

The **Ask the Video** project is hosted on GitHub, where you can find the source code, installation instructions, and usage guidelines. To get started:

1. Visit the [Ask the Video GitHub Repository](https://github.com/shruti9619/ask_the_video/tree/main).
2. Follow the setup instructions to clone the repository and run the application locally.
3. Contribute to the project by submitting issues, feature requests, or pull requests!
